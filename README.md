# Rents in Karlsruhe

Initially this was a visualization of rent prices in Karlsruhe, Germany: https://codeforkarlsruhe.github.io/mietmap

Now this code is refactored, so any German City can use this rentmap (Mietmap).

The data is based on ads from [Immobilienscout24](http://www.immobilienscout24.de/) and is collected using a custom scraper. The code for the heatmap generation can be found in a separate repository. Scraper and heatmap generator are both part of the repo.
